/*
 * (Sieve of Eratosthenes) A prime number is any integer greater than 1 thatâ€™s evenly divisible
only by itself and 1. The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a method of finding prime numbers. It operates as
follows:
a) Create a primitive-type boolean array with all elements initialized to true . Array ele-
ments with prime indices will remain true . All other array elements will eventually be
set to false .
b) Starting with array index 2, determine whether a given element is true . If so, loop
through the remainder of the array and set to false every element whose index is a mul-
tiple of the index for the element with value true . Then continue the process with the
next element with value true . For array index 2, all elements beyond element 2 in the
array that have indices which are multiples of 2 (indices 4, 6, 8, 10, etc.) will be set to
false ; for array index 3, all elements beyond element 3 in the array that have indices
which are multiples of 3 (indices 6, 9, 12, 15, etc.) will be set to false ; and so on.
When this process completes, the array elements that are still true indicate that the index is a
prime number. These indices can be displayed. Write an application that uses an array of 1,000 ele-
ments to determine and display the prime numbers between 2 and 999. Ignore array elements 0
